# MD5 Hashing Implementation in C

This project provides a simple implementation of the MD5 hashing algorithm in C programming language. MD5 is a widely used cryptographic hash function that takes an input message of arbitrary length and produces a fixed-size 128-bit hash value.

## Description

The provided code calculates the MD5 hash of a given input string and outputs the resulting 32-character hexadecimal hash value. The implementation follows the MD5 algorithm specifications and includes necessary functions for padding, bit-wise operations, and the main hash computation.

## Usage

1. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc` on Linux/macOS or Visual Studio on Windows).
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. The program will print the MD5 hash of the string "Hello, World!" as an example.

You can modify the `main` function to compute the MD5 hash of any other input string by changing the `input` variable.

Example output:

```
MD5 hash of "Hello, World!" is: 3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62
```

## Functions

The implementation includes the following functions:

- `md5_hash(const char *input, char *output)`: The main function that takes the input string and computes its MD5 hash, storing the result in the `output` buffer.
- `md5_process(uint32_t *buf, const uint32_t *in)`: Performs the main MD5 computation, updating the buffer with the processed hash values based on the input data.
- `md5_pad(uint8_t *data, uint64_t len, uint64_t *padded_len)`: Handles the padding of the input data according to the MD5 specification.

## Limitations

This implementation is for educational purposes and should not be used in production environments without proper validation and security review. Real-world cryptographic systems require robust and secure implementations, key management, and other security measures.

Additionally, this code only covers the MD5 hashing algorithm and does not include implementations for other algorithms like SHA-256.
